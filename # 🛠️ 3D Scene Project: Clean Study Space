# 🛠️ 3D Scene Project: Clean Study Space

## 📌 Project Overview
This 3D scene represents a **clean study space**, featuring a lamp constructed from multiple simple shapes. While the overall look is minimal and organized, building the scene—especially the lamp—required problem-solving and design planning. The lamp’s base includes several differently sized components that had to be stacked correctly, adding complexity to the build.

Both **orthographic and perspective views** were used to guide and finalize the design, giving the scene a sense of depth and realism while still allowing for precise adjustments.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me:

- Decompose complex objects into manageable, simple shapes.
- Practice spatial reasoning and stacking logic.
- Improve my skills in scene layout, camera angles, and lighting.
- Gain interest in 3D printing, leading me to purchase a printer to continue building.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- **Rendering Modes:** Orthographic and Perspective
- **Object Design:** Custom shape stacking and multi-part assembly
- **Iteration:** Adjusted object sizes and lamp parts over multiple versions
- **Inspiration:** Real-world organization and aesthetics

## 📈 Design Process
I approached this project by starting with rough shapes, then layering complexity as I refined the composition. The lamp was designed in parts, each tested for fit and proportion. Iteration was key—especially when aligning the bases and refining the visual balance of the scene.

---

## 🧩 Development Strategy
- Focused on **object modularity**: Each part of the lamp could be adjusted separately.
- Implemented **gradual refinement**: Frequent testing and visual checks guided improvements.
- Maintained a consistent **scale and alignment** system for realism and function.

## 🌱 What’s Next?
This project encouraged me to expand my technical design skills beyond the screen. I now plan to use these 3D modeling skills for real-world applications—like prototyping with my 3D printer and exploring more interactive digital environments.

## ❓ Final Reflection
How can the design and development process we use in 3D graphics carry over into more interactive, real-world applications?
