## Final Project: 3D Study Space Model in OpenGL
For my final project, I created a 3D representation of a clean and organized study space using OpenGL. The centerpiece of my scene is a notepad carefully placed on a flat desk surface, surrounded by additional elements that add life and structure to the space. One of the most complex parts of my model was the desk lamp. Despite being made from simple shapes, it proved to be the most challenging and rewarding object to construct.
I designed the lamp spontaneously, without any prior sketches or planning. I experimented as I went, using various base sizes that I had to carefully balance to create a realistic and stable look. I built it from basic 3D primitives and applied affine transformations—scaling, rotation, and translation—to align and scale each component precisely. Even though I used simple shapes, the lamp’s complexity pushed me to think more deeply about spatial organization and geometry in OpenGL.
I placed every object in the scene intentionally using X, Y, and Z coordinates. I took care to avoid unintentional clipping and made sure each item sat neatly in relation to the others to maintain the realistic layout of a desk setup. While the individual shapes were simple, combining them created a coherent and practical composition that felt natural and familiar.
For camera navigation, I used both perspective and orthographic views to explore the scene from different angles. This improved the depth and proportion of objects, making the environment more immersive. I also set up controls for horizontal, vertical, and depth movement, allowing me to view the workspace from multiple perspectives and understand the spatial relationships between objects.
I applied textures thoughtfully throughout the scene. I kept the texture use minimal to highlight the shape and structure of my models, but where I did apply textures, I made sure they were cleanly projected to avoid stretching or distortion. My focus was on maintaining visual clarity while adding a touch of surface variety.
Lighting played an important role in the final presentation. I used it to emphasize geometry and create a polished look for the scene. The lighting added depth to my model and helped define the silhouettes and shading of each object, contributing to the overall feel of a realistic, functional study space.
As I developed the scene, I focused on clean code structure and organization. I encapsulated tasks into custom functions whenever possible, which made my program more modular and easier to debug or expand in the future. For instance, I handled the construction and rendering of each object in separate functions to avoid redundancy.
This project sparked a deeper interest in 3D modeling and led me to purchase a 3D printer to explore physical modeling. Creating the OpenGL scene was a significant step, showing how rewarding it is to build complex objects from simple components and demonstrating OpenGL's power in creating immersive environments. It inspired me to keep learning and growing in both digital and physical modeling.
If I expanded this project, I’d add more study items like a pen, chair, or cup, use advanced textures and materials for realism, and explore dynamic lighting and shadows to enhance depth and atmosphere.
Overall, this final project helped me better understand the technical aspects of OpenGL and inspired me to learn beyond the classroom. From placing objects in 3D space to experimenting with lighting and camera movement, this experience was both technically challenging and creatively fulfilling.
